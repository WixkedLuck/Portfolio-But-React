# Description
- The motivation behind this project was to create a porfolio specific to me and my previous projects. Creating this website allows me to share some of my previous works and puts them on display for others to view even on different screen sizes!

- I built this project for recuiters in mind

- This project resolves having a working portfolio for users to view my projects and capabilities as I become a stronger web developer and programmer. Students who have working portfolios, can help with getting a job while showing employers your talents and abilities. Having several projects to view is a minimum requirement to recieve possible interviews.

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable on state changes within React.js and creatation of componenets.
